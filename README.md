I’m currently developing a real-world web application using C# ASP.NET Core MVC 8.0. The system uses Entity Framework for data access and Identity Framework for authentication and authorization. Every piece of data is associated with a specific user, and I aim to keep the application as stateless as possible to ensure scalability and broad accessibility.

The project doesn’t interact with the database directly. Instead, it follows a Clean Architecture approach where data flows through DTOs and view models using mappers. This allows for cleaner code, separation of concerns, and better control of data structures. I’m also applying patterns such as repositories and services, along with dependency injection, while managing the database through SSMS and T-SQL.

My plan is to expand the project by developing an API secured with JWT authentication, containerizing it with Docker, and documenting it using Swagger.

This project is more than just code for me—it’s something I genuinely enjoy. I spend my free time improving it, solving real-world problems, and exploring new technologies. I regularly read Windows documentation, take Udemy courses, and use AI prompts—not to copy solutions, but to truly understand what I’m building and strengthen my skills. AI has become an essential development tool, and I use it intentionally to boost productivity while continuing to learn as much as I can.
